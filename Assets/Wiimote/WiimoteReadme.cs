// STEPS FOR USING WII REMOTE (NOTE: Its only Setup in Office Scene)
//
// 1. Connect Wii Remote to PC/Laptop
//       On Windows 10/11 Devices:
//           1) Open Control Panel
//           2) Go to Sound and Devices -> Add a Device
//           3) On the Wii Remote, Press the (1) and (2) Buttons to Enter Pairing Mode
//           4) Connect to the Wii Remote
//              Note:
//              - It Should Show Up On the List of Available Devices as Nintendo RVL-CNT-1
//              - While Connecting, Ignore Pin and Press Next
//           5) Verify Connection By going to Settings-> Bluetooth and Devices
// 2. Once Connected to PC/Laptop, Turn on Wii Console with the infared bar sensor plugged in.
//    - This is so that the IR camera in the Wii Remote can be used to detect the screen location.
//    - If no infared bar is obtainable, theoretically, you can instead set up two heat sources (like candles) 
//      to act as the infared sensor, but I have not verified if this actually works.
// 3. Open the Unity Project and Go to Office Scene
// 4. Play the Office Scene 
//    - If The 1st and 4th light on the Wii Remote turn on, this means it connected correctly.
//    - If this does not occur, close the Unity Editor and Reconnect the Wii Remote to try again.
//
// 
// CONTROLS
// - Hold (A) Button to Turn on Laser.
// - Move Wii Remote to Move Laser (Press (Home) Button to Re-calibrate the Remote).
// - Press (B) Button to Turn off Distractions.
